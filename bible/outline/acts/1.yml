    summary: "The nerds split into pairs to investigate different angles: reviewing
      security footage, analyzing network logs, and interviewing staff. Their
      technical prowess is on display as they uncover anomalies in the logs and
      a suspicious gap in the camera feed. Meanwhile, the malfunctioning coffee
      machine becomes a running joke, providing comic relief amid the stress.
      The group’s efforts are hampered by management’s reluctance to involve law
      enforcement and a lack of cooperation from other departments, forcing the
      nerds to rely on their own resourcefulness."
