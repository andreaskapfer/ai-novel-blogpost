    summary: "The story opens with the Nerd Group—each member introduced through a
      humorous office scenario that highlights their technical specialties and
      eccentricities. The company, Quantum Solutions, is depicted as a lively,
      if slightly chaotic, IT consulting firm. On a seemingly ordinary day, the
      team’s routine is shattered when they discover the server room has been
      breached and all the GPUs powering the company’s AI infrastructure are
      missing. Initial chaos ensues: IT managers panic, executives demand
      answers, and the Nerd Group rallies under their unofficial leader, vowing
      to solve the crime themselves."

    summary: "The Nerd Group begins their investigation by examining the physical
      evidence: a broken lock, security camera footage, and odd traces left in
      the server room. Each member proposes a different theory, reflecting their
      unique perspectives—ranging from an external hacker attack to an inside
      job motivated by corporate rivalry. They start compiling a list of
      suspects, including rival IT firms, a disgruntled employee, and even a
      mysterious janitor who always seems to be around. Tensions bubble as
      suspicion briefly falls on one of their own."

    summary: Using their technical prowess, the group delves into digital forensics,
      analyzing access logs and surveillance data. They uncover a suspicious
      log-in during the night of the theft and a series of encrypted messages
      exchanged on the company’s internal chat. Meanwhile, personal dynamics
      within the group emerge—rivalries, insecurities, and budding friendships.
      Their investigation leads to small breakthroughs, such as identifying a
      possible motive linked to a failed AI project and a pattern of missing
      equipment from other departments.

    summary: "The Nerd Group’s investigation hits its first major obstacle: company
      management intervenes, warning them not to interfere, and suggests
      bringing in outside consultants. Despite the setback, the group continues
      their probe unofficially, working late into the night and using their
      access to company systems. They manage to recover a partial video clip
      showing a hooded figure entering the server room. The act ends with the
      group more determined than ever to uncover the truth, unaware that the
      real perpetrator is watching their every move."
