    summary: "The story opens with the nerd group arriving at the IT consulting
      company’s office, each member displaying their unique quirks and technical
      specialties. The narrative explores their daily routines: troubleshooting
      client servers, debating the merits of different programming languages,
      and collaborating on AI projects powered by the company’s prized GPU
      cluster. The company’s reliance on this infrastructure is made clear
      through a high-stakes client demo. Subtle tensions between the IT and
      sales departments surface, and rumors of a rival firm’s aggressive tactics
      circulate. The act builds toward the shocking discovery: the server room’s
      GPUs have vanished overnight, plunging the company into crisis."
