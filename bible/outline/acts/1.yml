    summary: "The nerd group debates their next steps. Some advocate calling the
      police immediately, while others argue for a discreet internal
      investigation to avoid bad press. The stakes are clarified: without the
      GPUs, the AI infrastructure is crippled, and ByteCrafters’ reputation is
      at risk. The group’s differing opinions create tension, but they
      ultimately agree to work together, forming a pact to recover the GPUs
      themselves. Their resolve marks the transition to a determined, united
      front."
