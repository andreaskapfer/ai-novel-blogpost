    summary: "The nerd group arrives at the IT consulting company to find the server
      room in chaos: security tape on the door, management in a panic, and the
      AI infrastructure offline. Sam, the hardware specialist, confirms the GPUs
      are missing. Management calls an emergency meeting, fueling rumors of
      layoffs and sabotage. The nerds, devastated and anxious about their jobs,
      resolve to investigate the theft themselves. They begin by reviewing
      security footage and compiling a list of people with access to the server
      room."

    name: "Turning Point: Sting Operation and Steeled Resolve"
    summary: The nerd group presents their initial findings to management, hoping
      for support but instead facing skepticism and warnings not to interfere.

      information to flush out the thief. The act ends with the nerds on edge,
      determined to solve the mystery before the company’s future—and their
      own—is irreparably damaged.
