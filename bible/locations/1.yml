type: office building
description: A modern open-plan office in a downtown high-rise, home to the nerd
  group and their colleagues. The office features glass-walled meeting rooms,
  rows of desks with dual monitors, a break room with a coffee machine, and a
  wall of whiteboards covered in diagrams and code. This is the central hub for
  the group’s daily work, camaraderie, and much of the story’s interpersonal
  drama.
