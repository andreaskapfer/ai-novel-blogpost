description: A secure, climate-controlled room within the IT consulting
  company’s office, filled with racks of high-performance servers and blinking
  lights. The heart of the company’s AI infrastructure, it is the site of the
  inciting incident—the theft of all GPUs. The room is protected by keycard
  access and security cameras, but the heist exposes vulnerabilities and sets
  the plot in motion.
